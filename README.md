# final-year-project
This is my final year project of my BSc. I was apart of a group of 4 people, where we developed a phone application which was a service marketplace for people looking to earn money for completing tasks locally, similar to Upwork and Fiverr. 

My main contributions were the databases (designing and implementing both MySQL and Firebase), implementing a realtime chat system between users logged in. I also implemented the majority of the front-end and back-end of the process of applying for jobs, accepted applications and completing jobs. In addition to this, I also wrote the code for job recommendations for users based on their skillsets and current location.

I also conducted a large amount of research into the intial stages of the project, including deciding which framework would be appropriate, and similar systems for inspiration.

The main deliverables (Abstract, Technical Report and Project Poster) can be found in the 'Deliverables' Folder.

I scored a result of 81% overall.
